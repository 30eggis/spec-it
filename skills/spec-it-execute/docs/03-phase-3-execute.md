# Phase 3: Execute

- Build dependency graph from plan
- Batch tasks for parallel execution
- For UI tasks tied to wireframes, batch by `02-wireframes/<user-type>/<domain>` groups
- Ensure `02-wireframes/shared/<domain>.md` is handled before domain batches
- Implement tasks with model routing
- Log each task to `.spec-it/execute/{sessionId}/logs/`
- Complete phase after all batches are implemented
